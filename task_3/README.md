**Task 3 Question 1**

Approach-
The Approach is simple to input no of test case then input the no of digits of binary code and 
binary code . Then get last digit of binary code and perfom action that is add or subtreact 1.
for convience north is 0, east is 1, south is 2, west is 3. For 0 in binary digit add 1 and subtact
1 for binary 1 and then finally get mod of the resulting loc we get the final direction if the 
person and then just print accoding to the above assumption.

**Task 3 Question 2**

Approach-
in this program, first we find the nos divisble by 4 then we find the mod of remaining nos such as 
1,2,3 and then we apply logic such as to get four.


**Task 3 Question 3**

Approach-
Simple approach, find the total odd number in array and subtract from the total elements in array.

**Task 3 Question 4**

Approach-
In this Problem, we will first check for the prime nos in array and add all prime no in a variable
.Then we would check for the unique digit in sum.

**Task 3 Question 5**

Approach-
Use cases as per position p.basics is to store element of a in order of the diagonals
